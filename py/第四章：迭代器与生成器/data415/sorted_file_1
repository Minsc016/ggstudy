Ah ~~~~~~
Ah~~~~Oh~~~~~
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (see you again) 
And every road you take will always lead you home
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride
And the vibe is feeling strong and what's small turn to a friendship
And when brotherhood come first then the line will never be crossed established it on our own
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Damn who knew all the planes we flew
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
Everything I went through you were standing where by my side
First you both go out your way
Good things we've been through
Had to switch up look at things different see the bigger picture
Hold every memory as you go
Hoo~~~
How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
It's been a long day without you my friend
It's been a long day without you my friend
It's been a long day without you my friend
Now I see you in a better place
Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
See You Again
So remember me when I'm gone
Talking to you 		about another path
That I'll be standing right here
Those were the days hard work forever pays
We've come a long way (yeah we've come a long way) from where we began (you know where we start it)
We've come a long way from where we began
We've come a long way from where we began
When I see you again
When I see you again
When I see you again
When I see you again ah~~~~~~o~~~~o~~~~
When I see you again see you again 
When that line had to be drawn and that line is what we reach
a friendship turn into a bond and that bond will never be broke and the love will never get lost
let the light guide your way
