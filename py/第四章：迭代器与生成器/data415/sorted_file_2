	----Robin Schulz
And if ya get burned,don't be surprised
And if you get burned,don't be surprised
Befo'ya play with fire,do things twice
Befor you play with fire,do things twice
But you won't get me tonight
Cold blooded vixen,she don't compromise
Got me trippin' higher than the ceilin'
Got me tripping higher than the ceiling
Got me tripping higher than the ceiling
Oh baby,it's the ultimate feelin'
Oh baby,it's the ultimate feeling
Ooh baby it's the ultimate feeling
Sean Penn a lil bit ethic,one's desire
She got cherry lips,angel eyes
She knows exactly how to tantalize
She's optimistic of the coded lights
She's optimistic of the coded lights
She's out to get u,danger by design
She's out to get you,you can't burn,you can't hide
So far from typical,but take my advice
So far from typical,but take my advice
Sugar Sugar how ya get so fly
Sugar how ya get so fly
Sugar how ya get so fly
Sugar how ya get so fly
Sugar how ya get so fly
Sugar how you get so fly
Sugar how you get so fly
Sugar how you get so fly
Sugar how you get so fly
Sugar how you get so fly
Sugar how you get so fly
Sugar how you get so fly
Sugar how you get so fly
Sugar sugar how you get so fly
Sugar we're just a rider,man spies
Sugar(feat. Francesco Yates)
We're talkin' lady,luv how you in tight
Ya got me lifted feelin' so gifted
Ya got me lifted feelin' so gifted
You got me lifted feeling so gifted
