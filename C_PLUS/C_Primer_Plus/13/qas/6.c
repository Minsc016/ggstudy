 The distinction between a binary file and a text file is a system-dependent difference 
 between file formats. The distinction between a binary stream and a text stream consists 
 of translations performed by the program as it reads or writes streams. (A binary stream 
 has no translations; a text stream may convert newline and other characters.)
