1.
1)fopen didn't specific the open-mode 
2)fputs usage : fputs("", fp)
3)flose use file-pointer,not file name.
// stdio.h
// fp is not a FILE * file pointer
// the out put need a new line Cause fputs() doesn't add one automatically.
// fuck.


2. 
paras less than 2 ,then exit.
open file (file name is the second parameter) to read, if cant open , then exit.
use a loop to get a single one character in file from the start to the end,
	if it is a number then display it.
close file,program excute finished.

3.
a. fp1 
b. fp2 ch
c. ch fp2/stdout
d. fp1

4.
Write a program that takes zero command-line arguments or one command-line 
argument. If there is one argument, it is interpreted as the name of a file. If there is no 
argument, the standard input ( stdin ) is to be used for input. Assume that the input 
consists entirely of floating-point numbers. Have the program calculate and report the 
arithmetic mean (the average) of the input numbers

5.  Write a program that takes two command-line arguments. The first is a character, and 
the second is a filename. The program should print only those lines in the file containing 
the given character. 
Note 
Lines in a file are identified by a terminating '\n' . Assume that no line is more than 256 characters long. You might want to use fgets().
